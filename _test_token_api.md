# Token-Based API Testing with cURL

This document provides complete cURL commands for testing all API endpoints using Bearer token authentication.

## üîë PREREQUISITE: TOKEN GENERATION

First, generate authentication tokens for both rider and driver accounts:

### Generate Rider Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Rider",
    "email": "rider@test.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123",
    "user_type": "rider"
  }'
```

### Generate Driver Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Driver",
    "email": "driver@test.com",
    "phone": "9876543211",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123",
    "user_type": "driver",
    "license_number": "DL1234567890",
    "vehicle_number": "KA01AB1234",
    "vehicle_type": "sedan",
    "vehicle_model": "Honda City",
    "vehicle_color": "White"
  }'
```

### Login to Get Fresh Tokens
```bash
# Login as Rider
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "rider@test.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# Login as Driver  
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "driver@test.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```
